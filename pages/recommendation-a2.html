          <td class="col-7"> Patient has been found to be "Anemic" and is between 13 weeks and 27 weeks pregnant. Full blood count testing is the recommended method for diagnosing anaemia in pregnancy. In settings where full blood count testing is not available, on-site haemoglobin testing with a haemoglobinometer is recommended over the use of the haemoglobin colour scale as the method for diagnosing anaemia in pregnancy. Patient will need a daily oral iron and folic acid supplementation with 30 mg to 60 mg of elemental irona and 400 Âµg (0.4 mg) folic acid is recommended for pregnant women to prevent maternal anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birth weight, and preterm birth.</td>
